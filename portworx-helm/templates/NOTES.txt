Portworx Pods should be running on each node in your cluster.

After a few minutes, you should be able to query the status of your Portworx cluster by logging into one of the nodes and issuing the command

    `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status`

No further action should be required and you are ready to consume Portworx Volumes as part of your application data requirements. 

For further information on usage of the Portworx data plane please refer to
